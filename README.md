# Project Overview
This project involved a comprehensive data analysis process divided into three key stages: data collection, data transformation, and data visualization. Each stage presented unique challenges and required specific solutions to achieve the final outcome.

##1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Collection
In the first stage, I utilized web scraping techniques to collect valuable table data from a website, akin to a pig foraging for truffles. üêΩ I implemented Python libraries such as Beautiful Soup and Requests to navigate the HTML structure of the site, ensuring efficient extraction of relevant job information, including job names, salaries, and locations.

##2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Transformation
Once the data was collected, the next step involved transforming the dataset for analysis. During this phase, I acted as a diligent cleaner by:

Removing Null Values: Identifying and dropping any null or incomplete entries to ensure data quality.
Changing Column Data Types: Adjusting data types to make sure that numerical fields were correctly formatted for analysis.
This careful preparation refined our dataset, making it suitable for visualization.

##3Ô∏è‚É£ Data Visualization
In the final stage, I created three insightful visuals using Power BI:

Top 10 Countries by Population: A visual representation highlighting the countries with the largest populations.
Countries with the Highest Median Age: An analysis of demographics showcasing countries with the oldest median age.
Top 5 Countries by Land Area: A visualization displaying the largest countries by land area.
üåçüìä These visuals effectively communicate the key insights derived from the dataset.

##Automation
To streamline the process, I also implemented an automated system using Python that sends the visualized results via email. This feature allows for easy sharing and accessibility of insights, making it beneficial for ongoing analysis and decision-making.

##Conclusion
This project exemplifies the power of data analysis in uncovering valuable insights, showcasing how effective data collection, transformation, and visualization can lead to informed decision-making.
