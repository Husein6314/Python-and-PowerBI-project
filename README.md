# Python-and-PowerBI-project
**Project Overview: 🐷🚀**

This project unfolded in three key stages: data collection, data transformation, and dashboarding, each with its unique set of challenges and solutions. In the data collection phase, I scoured the digital landscape, much like a pig foraging for truffles, to unearth valuable table data from a website. During the transformation phase, I acted as a diligent cleaner, dropping null values, and changing column data types to refine our dataset. Finally, in the visualization phase, I crafted three crystal-clear visuals: the top 10 countries by population, countries with the highest median age, and the top 5 countries by land area. This project exemplifies the power of data analysis to uncover valuable insights effectively. 🌍📈📊🐽
